
This part was thought and written by Archana Anand and Sowmya Ramakrishnan (We tried Python and Scala, both work). The logic for working on the Holmes and IMDb datasets is explained in READMEs in the respective folders.


**Note** : 
I have put .py code inside respective folder (holmes and imdb) as I am reading the input file from the code. So it differs in terms of input file name. Also run.sh will take the respective .py file
